# 🚦 UVM Topology Print Example – Active & Passive Agent

This repository contains a simple UVM example illustrating how to build and print the testbench topology for a design that includes **one active agent** and **one passive agent**.  
The example focuses on understanding UVM component hierarchy construction and how topology printing works during the build and end-of-elaboration phases.

## 🔍 What This Example Shows

- 🧩 How to declare and build UVM components  
- 🎛️ How active and passive agents are structured internally  
- 🔄 How topology changes depending on the agent type  
- 🖨️ How to print the complete UVM testbench hierarchy  
- ⚙️ How to configure an agent’s activity mode through the test class  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is mainly intended for:

- 🆕 Beginners learning UVM environment structure  
- 👁️ Understanding how agents behave when configured as passive or active  
- 🛠️ Demonstrating how topology printing helps debug UVM hierarchies
